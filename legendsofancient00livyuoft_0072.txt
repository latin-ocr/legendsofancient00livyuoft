EXERCISES.

A young man was sent to Rome to consult the
senate on this matter.

He Cwas-&carried down the Tiber and reached the
api o .

The senate decreed that Camillus should be
appointed dictator.

Meanwhile the Gauls, pulling each other up,
reached the top of the Capitol by night.

The geese sacred to J uno saved [were for a safety
to] the citadel.

Manlius, aroused from sleep by the cackling of the
geese, seized his arms.

The first of the Gauls, being thrown down by
Manlius, upset those next to him, and the
whole line was carried down headlong.

XVhen Manlius had been praised for his courage,
the sentry‚ by whose fault the Gauls had climbed
up, was hurled down from the rock.

Now each army pressed by hunger [hunger press-
ing] wished for peace.

A truce having been made, it was arranged be·
tween the leaders on both sides that the Gauls,
having received a thousand pounds of gold,
should go away from Rome.

Some say that the chieftain of the Gauls added
his sword to the weight, and exclaimed “ lVoe
to the conquered !’'

. In the midst of [inter] the bargaining Camillus

arrived with 1118 army, and gave orders that
the gold should be taken away.
