PREFACE.

THIS selection has been compiled for the use of boys
, who could make out an easy passage of such an
author as Caesar, but would be stopped by long or
‹lstficult sentences It is hoped that the passages
xvssl be found, at any rate in the earher part of
the book, to be of progressive difficulty. The attempt
to attain this end has led to the omission of some
legends of the ldngs uffnch couhl not have been
rnade easy enough xvsthout inueh aheraffion of the
text. As this would have left them not Livy’s‚
but something very inferior, it was thought better
to onut then1 astogethen ⁴

The text has been simplified mainly by omissions,
which have sometimes been large. Moral and
political reflections, and many rhetorical passages,
have been left out hodily. Elaborate periods have
been, omitted, or, where they contained matter
essential to the story, broken up. In one or two
places the order of words has been simplified
where it seemed likely to offer needless difficulty

to young boys.
