GENERAL NOTE.—The chief difficulty which will be found
by boys beginning this book will probably be the order of
words in the sentence. The subject will constantly come in
the middle or ab the end of the sentence, and the verb, object,
etc„ in rather unexpected places. Careful parsing will, how-

ever, soon get over the difficulty.
